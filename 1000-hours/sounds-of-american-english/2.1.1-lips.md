# 2.1.1. 口型（Mouth shape）

人类的语音在最底层是相通的 —— 最明显的例证就是所有的语言都一样，不仅都以元音为核心，并且，都有大致相同的基础元音音素，比如 `ɑ`、`i`、`ʊ`、`e`、`ɔ`…… 日文就恰好只有这五个母音。英文还另外有一个 `ə`；而韩文比英文还要多出一个 `ɤ`<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-other="/audios/us/Close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel.ogg.mp3"></span>（韩文字符为 `ᅳ`） —— 这个音中文也有，比如，在 “思念” 这个词中， “思”（`sī`）的韵母就是这个音。

Human speech, at its core, is universal - the clearest example being that all languages share certain fundamental tenets. Every language places vowels at their heart and maintains a similar basic vowel phonemes such as `ɑ`, `i`, `ʊ`, `e`, `ɔ`, amongst others. Take Japanese for instance; it uses precisely these five vowels only. English includes one more: `ə`. Korean even outpaces English by adding another one —`ɤ`<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-other="/audios/us/Close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel.ogg.mp3"></span> (represented in Hangul as `ᅳ`). Interestingly enough you can find this sound in Mandarin Chinese too — like in `sī` of "思念" `sīniàn`, meaning to miss or remember.

元音发声时，气流从肺部通过声门冲击**声带**，使其均匀震动，而后通过起着共鸣器作用的口腔，无阻力地呼出。

For vowel pronunciation, the airflow from your lungs strikes against your *vocal cords* through the glottis. This produces a consistent vibration that is amplified as it travels unimpeded through your mouth - the resonator cavity - before being expelled freely.

生成不同元音的主要器官是嘴唇，这也是婴幼儿在学说话时所能观察到的唯一发声器官。张嘴的另外一个器官是下巴，下巴拉开，口型变大。

Notably, a prime organ involved here: lips - the only visible speech articulator observable when infants are learning to speak. Another organ that opens the mouth is the jaw, which, when pulled apart, enlarges the shape of the mouth.

以下是  5 个基础元音发声时的口型（嘴唇位置）：

Here are the mouth shapes (or, lips positions) during enunciation of five basic vowels:

当然，除了嘴唇的形状之外，影响元音发声的器官还有舌面的位置、软腭的动作 —— 影响口腔内气流共振的空间 —— 不过，由于人类语言的相通属性，人们在这些基础元音的发声上都没有任何困难。

Certainly, besides the mouth, other articulators influencing vowel pronunciation include where tongue lies and what's happening with soft palate, forming  a specific space that affects the resonance of airflow in the mouth. But thanks to universal linguistic attributes in humans, no one really struggles when it comes down to these basic vowels.

另外，英文的 `ə` 口型与 `e` 接近；而 `æ` 的口型比 `e` 的大一点、比 `ɑ` 的小一点。

Moreover, regarding English phonetics: the mouth shape for `ə` is similar to that for `ɪ`, whereas for `æ`, a slightly larger opening is formed than when saying `e`, but smaller one compared with pronouncing `ɑ`.
